name: Intel Open Source
description: 01.org is where we pull together open source work that Intel engineers
  are involved in. Herersquo;s where you can find projects we maintain and contribute
  to in one location, from the most widely known, the Linux kernel, to very focused
  projects, like oFono and SyncEvolution, to the ones we started here at Intel and
  provide full hosting for, like PowerTop and the Web Simulator. Each project has
  its own micro-site, where itrsquo;s easy to learn about the project and engage in
  the community. And Intel open source maintainers and developers will find all the
  tools needed to host a project.
