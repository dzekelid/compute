description: Our simple platform lets you take control of your server. With elastic
  server sizing, you can easily assemble your server to fit your needs. Choose exactly
  how much CPU, memory, and disk space you need, without paying extra for what you
  might not use. Our virtual hard drives and servers offer the same customization
  you???d find with a physical server, right at your fingertips. Plug together pieces
  in different combinations, resize them, easily move drives from one server to another,
  or put two drives on a single server. It???s up to you.
